**Notes for Reviewer:**
This app requires a MySondyGo Bluetooth device to receive weather balloon telemetry. For testing purposes, the app can also display data from the APRS network without hardware.

To test:
1. Launch the app
2. The app will automatically attempt to connect to available data sources
3. APRS data will be available without additional hardware
4. Map and prediction features can be tested with APRS data
